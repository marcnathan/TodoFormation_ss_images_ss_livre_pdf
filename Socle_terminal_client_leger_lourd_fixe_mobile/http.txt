							- HTTP Methods
								
								Compare GET vs. POST
									The following table compares the two HTTP methods: GET and POST.

									Bookmarked					Can be bookmarked						Cannot be bookmarked
									Cached						Can be cached							Not cached

									History						Parameters remain in browser history	Parameters are not saved in browser history
									Restrictions on data length	Yes, when sending data, the GET method	No restrictions
																adds the data to the URL; and the 
																length of a URL is limited 
																(maximum URL length is 2048 characters)
									Restrictions on data type	Only ASCII characters allowed			No restrictions. Binary data is also allowed
									Security					GET is less secure compared to POST 
																because data sent is part of the URL

																Never use GET when sending passwords 	POST is a little safer than GET because the parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs
																or other sensitive information!	
									Visibility					Data is visible to everyone in the URL	Data is not displayed in the URL
									
								Other HTTP Request Methods
									The following table lists some other HTTP request methods:

									Method	Description
									HEAD	Same as GET but returns only HTTP headers and no document body
									PUT		Uploads a representation of the specified URI
									DELETE	Deletes the specified resource
									OPTIONS	Returns the HTTP methods that the server supports
									CONNECT	Converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel
