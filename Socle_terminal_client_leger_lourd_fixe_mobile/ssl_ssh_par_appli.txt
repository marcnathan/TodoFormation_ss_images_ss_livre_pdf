		- can connect to GitHub without supplying your username or password at each visit.
		- checking for existing SSH keys
			- ls -al ~/.ssh
			- By default, the filenames of the public keys are one of the following:

				id_dsa.pub
				id_ecdsa.pub
				id_ed25519.pub
				id_rsa.pub

			- If you don't have an existing public and private key pair, or don't wish to use any that are available to connect to GitHub, then generate a new SSH key.
			- If you see an existing public and private key pair listed (for example id_rsa.pub and id_rsa) that you would like to use to connect to GitHub, you can add your SSH key to the ssh-agent.

		- ajout du ssh key au ssh-agent
			- Before adding a new SSH key to the ssh-agent to manage your keys, you should have checked for existing SSH keys and generated a new SSH key.
				- Start the ssh-agent in the background.
					- eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
				- Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_rsa in the command with the name of your private key file.
					- ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
		- Add the SSH key to your GitHub account
			- Copy the SSH key to your clipboard
			- In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click Settings
		- Test de connection
			- ssh -T git@github.com
