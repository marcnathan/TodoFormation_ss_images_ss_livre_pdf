		- Creational Patterns
			- Abstract Factory 				Sets of methods to make various objects.
			- Builder 						Make and return one object various ways.
			- Factory Method 				Methods to make and return components of one object various ways.
			- Multiton
			- Pool							Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use 
			- Prototype 					Make new objects by cloning the objects which you set as prototypes.
			- Simple Factory				
			- Singleton 					A class distributes the only instance of itself.
			- Static Factory
		- Structural Patterns
			- Adapter 						A class extends another class, takes in an object, and makes the taken object behave like the extended class.
			- Bridge 						An abstraction and implementation are in different class hierarchies.
			- Composite 					Assemble groups of objects with the same signature.
			- Data Mapper
			- Decorator 					One class takes in another class, both of which extend the same abstract class, and adds functionality.
			- Dependency Injection
			- Facade 						One class has a method that performs a complex process calling several other classes.
			- Fluent Interface
			- Flyweight 					The reusable and variable parts of a class are broken into two classes to save resources.
			- Private Class Data
			- Proxy 						One class controls the creation of and access to objects in another class.
			- Registry
		- Behavorial Patterns
			- Chain Of Responsibility 		A method called in one class can move up a hierarchy to find an object that can properly execute the method.
			- Command 						An object encapsulates everything needed to execute a method in another object.
			- Interpreter 					Define a macro language and syntax, parsing input into objects which perform the correct opertaions.
			- Iterator 						One object can traverse the elements of another object.
			- Mediator 						An object distributes communication between two or more objects.
			- Memento 						One object stores another objects state.
			- Null Object					Designed to act as a default value of an object 
			- Observer 						An object notifies other object(s) if it changes.
			- Specification
			- State 						An object appears to change its` class when the class it passes calls through to switches itself for a related class.
			- Strategy 						An object controls which of a family of methods is called. Each method is in its` own class that extends a common base class.
			- Template Method				An abstract class defines various methods, and has one non-overridden method which calls the various methods.
			- Visitor
		- Other PHP Design Patterns
			- Non OO MVC 					MVC - Model View Controller - shown using procedural and not OO architecture.
			- Delegation
			- Service Locator
			- Repository
			- Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV)
